## 💡 My Approach

I redesigned the skip selection interface with a strong focus on **user experience, performance, and accessibility**. Here’s a summary of what I improved:

### ✅ Interface Improvements

* Created **modular, reusable components** like `SkipCard` and `SkipSelection`
* Added **carousel-based navigation** using Embla Carousel with autoplay
* Used **image mapping** logic to dynamically load skip images by size
* Integrated **dark/light mode** toggle with smooth transitions

### ✅ UX & Design

* Ensured **mobile-first responsiveness** and touch gesture support
* Applied **visual enhancements** like hover states, gradient backgrounds, and card animations
* Added **"Popular" badge**, step indicators, and filtering UI

### ✅ Accessibility & Performance

* Provided **keyboard navigation and screen reader support**
* Optimized images and animations for **smooth performance**
* Applied **semantic HTML** and responsive layout best practices
